    <p>I have always been fascinitated by the advancement of technology in our world today, and how individual with brilliant
        minds solve problems faced by people with lines of code. Being a Nurse, I believe that their are problems I 
        can solve, not just with my clinical abilities, but also with my technical abilities, hence my decision to 
        actively pursue a career in technology. In the nearest future, I hope to bring tecnological advancement to
